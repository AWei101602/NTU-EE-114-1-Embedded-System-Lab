PWM and Logic Analyzer

====basic problem====

Please read some information about PWM techniques and applications in Internet resources (such as https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-width_modulation, https://electricalfundablog.com/pulse-width-modulation/, ...) and find an application that you are interested in. And generate the PWM waveforms for the applications, which can be observed using a logic analyzer. Show some waveform observations in your Demo to TA.
